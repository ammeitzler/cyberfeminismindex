Arial Symbol is a set of numbers, 1–2000, that become encircled ligatures when using the syntax “(1)”, “(2)”, “(2000)”, etc., with additional useful symbols ← ↑ → ↓ ○ ● ⋱*. The typeface was designed by Laura Coombs (lauracoombs.com) in 2020, commissioned for the Cyberfeminism Index website (cyberfeminismindex.com). Arial Symbol glyphs are not Arial®, but they are drawn using metrics parallel to Arial®, for compatibility of use in print and on the web. © Laura Coombs, 2020.
